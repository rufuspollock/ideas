A public database of ideas ~~projects~~ (see note below on projects vs ideas).

### Naming: "ideas" over "projects"

Using term "idea" rather than "project" because ...

Projects are something you work on. Ideas are something to explore.

Ideas inspire. Projects are chores that kill desire.

That's why this is my ideas not my projects.

Ideas may never get implemented -- and i can still think about them. Projects have to happen -- there's a sense of obligation.
